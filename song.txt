Hear them whisper,
Voices from the other side
Hear them calling
Former foes now friends are resting side by side

They will never
Leave our hearts or fade away
Live forever
They were far to you to die
In such a way

How many wasted lives
How many dreams did fade away
Broken promises
They won't be coming home

Oh mothers wipe your tears
Your sons will rest a million years
Found their peace at last
As foe turned to friend
And forgive

And they knew they'd die
Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust
